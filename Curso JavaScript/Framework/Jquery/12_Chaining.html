    <hr>
    <p>With jQuery, you can chain together actions/methods.</p>
    <p>Chaining allows us to run multiple jQuery methods (on the same element) within a single statement.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 class="h2-ro">jQuery Method Chaining</h2>
    <p>Until now we have been writing jQuery statements one at a time (one after the other).</p>
    <p>However, there is a technique called chaining, that allows us to run multiple jQuery commands, one after the other, on the same element(s).</p>
    <p><b>Tip:</b> This way, browsers do not have to find the same element(s) more than once.</p>
    <p>To chain an action, you simply append the action to the previous action. </p>
    <p>The following example chains together the css(), slideUp(), and slideDown() methods. The &quot;p1&quot; element first changes to red, then it slides up, and then it slides down: </p>

    <p id="p1">jQuery multiples methods/actions</p>
    <button id="btn">Clique-me!</button>

    <p>We could also have added more method calls if needed.</p>
    <p><b>Tip</b>: When chaining, the line of code could become quite long. However, jQuery is not very strict on the syntax; you can format it like you want, including line breaks and indentations. </p>
    <p>This also works just fine:</p>

    <!-- CÃ³digo javascript -->
    <script src="jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function(){
            $("#btn").click(function(){
                $("#p1").css("color", "red").slideUp(2000).slideDown(2000);
            })
        })
    </script>
</body>
