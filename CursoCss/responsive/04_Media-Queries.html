            <h2>What is a Media Query?</h2>
            <p>Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.</p>
            <p>It uses the <code class="w3-codespan">@media</code> rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a

            <h2>Add a Breakpoint</h2>
            <p>Earlier in this tutorial we made a web page with rows and columns, and it was responsive, but it did not look good on a small screen.</p>
            <p>Media queries can help with that. We can add a breakpoint where certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.</p>

              <h2>Typical Device Breakpoints</h2>
              <p>There are tons of screens and devices with different heights and widths, so it is hard to create an exact breakpoint for each device. To keep things simple you could target five groups:</p>
