            <p>
                Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Characters that are not present on your keyboard can also be replaced by entities.

        <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
        <p>
            Some characters are reserved in HTML
        </p>
        <p>
            If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.
        </p>
        <p>
            Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            A character entity looks like this:
        </p>
        <div id="coment-code">
            <code>
                &entity_name;<br>
                OR<br>
                &#entity_number;
            </code>
        </div>
        <p>
            To display a less than sign (<) we must write: <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&#60;</b>
        </p>
        <div class="code-2">
            <p>
                <strong>Advantage of using an entity name:</strong> An entity name is easy to remember.<br>
                <strong>Disadvantage of using an entity name:</strong> Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for numbers is good.
            </p>
        </div><hr>
        <h2>Non-breaking space</h2>
        <p>
            A common character entity used in HTML is the non-breaking space: &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.
        </p>
        <p>Examples:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>§ 10</li>
            <li>10 km/h</li>
            <li>10 PM</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="code-2">
            <p>
                The non-breaking hyphen (&#8209;) lets you use a hyphen character (‑) that won't break.
            </p>
        </div><hr>
