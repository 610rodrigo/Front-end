            <li>
            XHTML is stricter than HTML
            </li>
            <li>XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application</li>

        <h2>Why XTHML?</h2>
        <p>
            Many pages on the internet contain "bad" HTML.
        </p>
        <p>
            This HTML code works fine in most browsers (even if it does not follow the HTML rules):
        </p>
        <div class="sombra-painel">
            <div class="painel">
                <code>
                    &lt;html><br>
                    &lt;head><br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title>
                      This is bad HTML
                      &lt;/title><br>
                    <br>&lt;body><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1>Bad HTML
                        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p>This is a paragraph
                    <br>&lt;/body>
                </code>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Today's market consists of different browser technologies. Some browsers run on computers, and some browsers run on mobile phones or other small devices. Smaller devices often lack the resources or power to interpret "bad" markup.
        </p>
        <p>
           XML is a markup language where documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed").

        <p>
            By combining the strengths of HTML and XML, XHTML was developed.
        </p>
        <p>
            XHTML is HTML redesigned as XML.
