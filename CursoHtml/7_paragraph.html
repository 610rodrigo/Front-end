HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    <p>This is a another paragraph</p>
<!---
HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new
paragraph:
-->
    <p>This is anoter paragraph <br>this is line break <br></p>
<!--
The HTML <pre> Element
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font
(usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
-->
    <br><p>The pre tag preserves both spaces and line breaks:</p>
    <pre>
      My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

      My Bonnie lies over the sea.

      My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

      Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
    </pre>
  </body>
