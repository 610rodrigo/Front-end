HTML Comments

Comment tags are used to insert comments in the HTML source code.
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the opening tag, but not in the closing tag.

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

This is a comment
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
Comments are not displayed in the browser

</body>
</html>

-->
Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors:

<!-- Do not display this at the moment
<img border="0" src="pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain">
-->

Conditional Comments
You might stumble upon conditional comments in HTML:

<!--[if IE 9]>
    .... some HTML here ....
<![endif]-->

Conditional comments defines some HTML tags to be executed by Internet Explorer only.
